# hello-world
My first GitHub project. A greeting to cyberspace
I am a 31 year old returned to college student. Since losing my leg in 2014 I have discovered a new drive 
to pursue the quality of life that is representative of efficent effort applied liberally. My amazing, supportive
wife is a driving force in my life and she pushes me to the next level daily. By this time next year, I plan on 
making living arrangements with my wife following my acceptance to UC Berkeley into their college of engineering.
Look out world, I'm on the charge.
